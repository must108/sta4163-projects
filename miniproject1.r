# Step 0:
# P-Values for both Shapiro tests are greater than 0.05, making
# both datasets normally distributed. It can reasonably
# be assumed that data was collected through a random sample.

# Step 1/2:
# H0: The population variance of automatic and manual cars are equal.
# HA: The population variance of automatic and manual cars are not equal.

# Step 3/4:
# After conducting a variance test, we can see that the ratio of variances
# is 0.3865615, with a RR of >0.1243721 and <1.0703429. As the ratio
# doesn't fall in this interval, we fail to reject the HO.

# Step 5:
# At Î± = 0.05, we fail to reject the HO (ratio doesn't fall in interval).
# We conclude that there is not enough evidence to reject the claim
# of variance between automatic and manual cars being equal.
